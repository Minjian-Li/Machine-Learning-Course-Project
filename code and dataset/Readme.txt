=======================================================
Instructions:
============
- In this folder we include original dataset in "original.csv"
- We did preprocessing data by R-studio, then we get the new dataset "cleaned_tweet.csv"
- After we get "cleaned_tweet.csv", we create feature using bag-of-word technique.
- Then, we split data into training, validation, testing dataset using R-studio with 
	We have - "x_train.csv", "y_train.csv"
		- "x_validation.csv", "y_validation.csv"
		- "x_test.csv", "y_test.csv" ready for training
- Main programming is in "Main.py"
- The rest is just we try to come up with the different model.
This programming part equally contributed by both of us.
